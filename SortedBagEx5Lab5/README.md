### Lab 5: Binary Search Tree

Implement in  C++ the given container(ADT) using a given representation and a binary search tree (BST) as a data structure.\
You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library.\
Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), implement the container directly!

exercise 5. **ADT SortedBag**
  - using a BST with linked representation with dynamic allocation.
  - In the BST (unique element, frequency) pairs are stored.
